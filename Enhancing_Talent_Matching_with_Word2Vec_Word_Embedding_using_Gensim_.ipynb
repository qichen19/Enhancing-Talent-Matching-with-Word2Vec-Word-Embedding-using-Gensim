When you are writing letters, it's important to select a font that is clear and easy to read.  Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter.  It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter doesn't fit well on a page.  Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read.  Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well.  Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size.  It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page.  Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your cover letter.  Here's how to space your cover letter.  When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size.  If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar.  Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size.  You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page.  How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your cover letter.  Highlight the content of your letter.  Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document.        Experience      Production Associate   03/2006   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State       cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.  Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.  A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.  Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.  A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.  Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.  There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek.  Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).  Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).  The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.  Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty.  Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.

This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g. pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.  Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment for a mission critical product.  Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for more than 10 years in a row.  Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate new quality products as well as support existing products in production.  Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production since 2013.  Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.  Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform. IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.  My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from monolithic architecture to service based architecture.  Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.  Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.  Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market.
